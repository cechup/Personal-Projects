1. [Project 1: Developing a Language Model for
Identifying Anorexia Nervosa](https://github.com/cechup/Personal-Projects/blob/main/LLM_AnorexiaNervosa.pdf)
   - Description: We delved into an in-depth exploration of each theoretical step crucial for LLM development. This method enabled us to understand the complexities associated with building an effective model for early anorexia nervosa detection via a chatbot interface. Our journey involved exhaustive literature reviews, comprehensive database analyses, and rigorous ethical considerations. Inspiration was drawn from previously published works, even those banned for ethical reasons.
